I am interested in artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, machine learning, and optimization. I am a Ph.D. candidate of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Iowa State University, and I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Qing Li](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/qing-li/). Before that, I received Bachelor's degree from the School Of Statistics at East China Normal University. Then I received the Master of Science in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After that, I expected to applied theoretical statistical and mathematical knowledge to practical. It is the motivation I pursued a Ph.D. degree in a new field - Industrial Engineering at ISU. Currently, I am working on statistical analysis on Additive Manufacturing products.
